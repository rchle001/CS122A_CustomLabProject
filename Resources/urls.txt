(unused - tried to use uterrupts with USART, but did not go well because apparently using these types of interrupts do not work well with USART)

(used - was running out of time when I noticed that COM's 7 and 8 were serial bluetooth, so I searched for how to read from COM ports ; not all of it is needed for the project)
